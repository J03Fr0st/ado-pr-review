# Azure DevOps Pull Request Reviewer PRD

## 1. Product Overview
- VS Code extension that lets Azure DevOps reviewers triage, review, and manage pull requests without leaving the IDE.
- Focus on accelerating reviewer workflow by surfacing the most common review actions alongside PR context and discussion threads.

## 2. Goals and Success Metrics
- Reduce reviewer context-switching time by providing a complete PR management experience inside VS Code.
- Enable reviewers to approve or reject a PR in fewer than three clicks from the extension.
- Surface outstanding tasks (unresolved comments, requested changes) within five seconds of opening a PR panel.
- Track adoption through number of active reviewers per week and average time spent in the extension versus the Azure DevOps web portal.

## 3. Personas and Use Cases
- **Primary reviewer:** Software engineer who regularly participates in code reviews and wants to stay within VS Code.
- **Repository maintainer:** Engineer responsible for merging PRs and managing reviewer assignments.
- **Occasional reviewer:** Contributor who needs lightweight access to PR status and commenting capabilities.

## 4. Scope
- **In scope:** Azure DevOps pull request workflows for code reviewers, including listing PRs, reviewing diffs, taking approval actions, and commenting.
- **Out of scope:** GitHub or other provider integrations, build and release pipelines, work item triage, or deep repository analytics.

## 5. User Experience
- Provides a dedicated Azure DevOps PR activity view, surfaced from the VS Code sidebar, with nested lists of repositories and pull requests.
- PR detail view offers file tree, diff viewer, reviewer status, and inline commands for actions (vote, abandon, comment, open in browser).
- Comment experience uses a webview surfaced in VS Code to show threaded discussions and allow replies, resolves, and file-specific comments.

## 6. Functional Requirements
- R1: **List Pull Requests** for configured Azure DevOps project repositories.
- R2: **View Pull Request Content**, including added, modified, and deleted files with diff support.
- R3: **Approve Pull Request** directly from the extension, registering reviewer vote.
- R4: **Reject Pull Request** with optional comment, updating vote state accordingly.
- R5: **Create New Pull Request** by selecting repository, source branch, target branch, title, and description.
- R6: **Abandon Pull Request** to close a PR without merging.
- R7: **Open Pull Request in Browser** via deep link to Azure DevOps web experience.
- R8: **Add Comment to Pull Request**, including replies, resolves, and file/thread targeting.
- R9: **Refresh Pull Requests** on demand to sync status with Azure DevOps.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
- Authenticate using Azure DevOps personal access tokens stored in VS Code Secret Storage.
- All API interactions must respect Azure DevOps REST API rate limits and return meaningful error feedback in VS Code notifications.
- Extension should initialize and fetch the first page of pull requests within five seconds on a standard network (100 ms latency).
- Provide instrumentation hooks for telemetry (command usage, action success/failure) with opt-in user consent.

## 8. Dependencies and Integrations
- Azure DevOps REST APIs for pull request, repository, and comment management.
- VS Code extension APIs for tree views, webviews, commands, and secret storage.
- User-provided Azure DevOps organization URL, project, and PAT configured via command palette workflow.

## 9. Risks and Mitigations
- **PAT misconfiguration:** Provide validation and clear error messages during configuration workflow.
- **Permission limitations:** Detect insufficient scopes and guide users to update PAT permissions.
- **Large PR performance:** Implement incremental loading of files and diffs; consider lazy loading comments per file.
- **API instability or throttling:** Implement retry with backoff and cache recent PR metadata locally per session.

## 10. Rollout Plan
- **Private preview:** Internal engineering team validates core flows on sample projects.
- **Public preview:** Publish VSIX for early adopters; gather telemetry and feedback.
- **General availability:** Release in VS Code Marketplace with documentation, support guide, and onboarding checklist.

## 11. Open Questions
- Should reviewers be able to edit PR descriptions or update target branches?
- What offline capabilities (if any) are required for diff viewing and commenting?
- Do we need extension-level policy enforcement (e.g., disallow self-approval)?

## 12. Appendix
- Azure DevOps REST API documentation and rate limit policies.
